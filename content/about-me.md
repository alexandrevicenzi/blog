Hi, I'm Alex, a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience. Born and raised in the beautiful state of Santa Catarina â€” Brazil, I currently live in the Czech Republic, in the heart of Europe.

Today my role is a mix of Tech Lead and Team Lead, but focusing more on technical details rather than people management. I don't write code all the time anymore, there are days or even weeks that I don't write code at all, instead, I spend a lot of my time on scoping and designs of new features and understanding of stakeholders requirements, to ensure that my team is going in the right direction.

I believe and contribute to open source. There's a handful of projects on my GitHub account. Besides creating my own projects, contributing to existing ones is also important. Notable mentions to LibreOffice, one of the first projects that I contributed, as well as Mozilla Firefox, one of the longest that I've been part of. Not all my contributions are code related, Firefox itself is one example, I contribute to it by testing and report issues.

Sharing knowledge is part of my nature. In 2014, I co-founded a blog to share experiences and over the years I've written a dozen articles and I still write regularly. You can check out [here][buteco], but it's in Portuguese.

Not being enough already, I also co-founded a hackerspace in Blumenau in 2016. While in Brazil, I had the opportunity to hold multiple meetups, as well to drive [FLISoL Blumenau][flisol], an event that occurs simultaneously in multiple cities across Latin America.

Outside Brazil, I had the opportunity to be a volunteer at [QCon][qcon] and [DevConf.CZ][devconf].

Topics that I'm interested in and research in my free time are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Personally, I have an interest in autonomous systems and self-driving cars. I'm no expert in these fields, but I like to keep an eye on trends.

Aside from tech, my hobbies include traveling, photography, and music.
