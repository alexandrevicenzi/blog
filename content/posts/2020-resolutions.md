Every year we make some kind of promise, well, this year I made a resolution to create a new blog after a while without writing to any blogs.

The main reason to start a new blog is that I enjoy writing but it's usually hard to find time to keep a blog with frequent updates. That being said, I'll try to write occasionally about what comes up in my mind, usually tech-related topics.

In case you are interested, this blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Soho](https://themes.gohugo.io/soho) theme and is hosted with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
